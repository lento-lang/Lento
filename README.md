# Welcome!

Lento is an open-source, strongly typed and lazy evaluated programming language with aim to purify the object-oriented paradigm.
Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing Lento to validate that your code is working correctly.
This project provides a helpful command line interface tool for the Lento programming language.
